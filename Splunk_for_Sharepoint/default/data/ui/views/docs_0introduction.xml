<h1>Welcome to the Splunk App for Microsoft SharePoint 2010</h1>

<p>This app is designed to provide comprehensive data collection and field extraction from Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and
a set of starting dashboards covering health, audit and usage.  The data collection includes the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>SharePoint Object Inventory</li>
 <li>Service and Performance Information</li>
 <li>Network Latency Information</li>
 <li>IIS Logs</li>
 <li>ULS Logs</li>
 <li>SharePoint Audit Logs</li>
</ul>

<p>This app will not work until all installation is completed.  The installation process will take some time and some adjustment 
to the permissions structures that govern the SharePoint farm.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

Splunk v5.0.3 or later on all Splunk servers within the central Splunk instance.  Splunk v6.0 is not supported at this time.</p>

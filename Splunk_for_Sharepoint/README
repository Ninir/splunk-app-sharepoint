Installing Splunk App for Sharepoint
------------------------------------

1) Install the Splunk Universal Forwarder (v5.0.2.2 or later) on all Sharepoint and SQL Servers

	* The Universal Forwarder installed on the Central Administration host needs special privileges
		- Must be a domain user
		- The domain user must also be a Farm Administrator
		- The domain user must also have PowerShell (Add-SPShellAdmin) access
		- The domain user must have sysadmin privileges on the SQL Server for all content databases and the Sharepoint_Config database

	* All other universal forwarders can be installed as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

2) Prepare the Indexing Layer
	
	* Create the following indices: mssharepoint, iis, perfmon.
	* Also create "mssql" index if deploying TA-SQLServer.

3) Prepare the Sharepoint Servers
	
Configure Audit Log Reporting:
	* Open up SharePoint 2010 Central Administration (run as Farm Administrator)
	* Select Site Actions->Site Settings
	* Under Site Collection Administration, select Site collection audit settings
	* Under Audit Log Trimming, select Yes and enter a number greater than 3 (example: 7) for the number of days of audit log data to retain.
	* Leave the location to store audit reports blank
	* Under every other section, check the box necessary to turn on audit 
	* Click on OK
			
4) Install Splunk for Sharepoint on the Search Head

5) Deploy the following apps per role:

	SQL Server:		Splunk_TA_Windows, SA-ModularInput-PowerShell, TA-SQLServer
	Sharepoint 2010 Server:	Splunk_TA_Windows, TA-Sharepoint2010, TA-Windows2008R2-IIS

6) Regenerate all lookups after 24 hours (takes overnight to gather all the data!)

7) Edit lookups/HostMapping.csv to map each combination of HOST and PORT to the appropriate Url listed in the SPWebApplication table.  E.g.

host,s_port,Url
APP01,3000,http://app01:3000/
APP01,80,http://sharepoint.shellmonger.com/
WEB01,80,http://sharepoint.shellmonger.com/
WEB02,80,http://sharepoint.shellmonger.com/

We need to properly determine the Web Application from the IIS logs and this table is the quickest method of doing it.  This table should
not change often.

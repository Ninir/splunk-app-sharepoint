Farm-Friendly Naming

Edit the file FarmNames.csv.  Each line should contain one Farm 
specified by Id and it's "friendly" name.  For example

FarmId,FarmName
730eee5b-de80-4b27-9b11-d8ff7aca7509,Production
aeeeb157-e531-4969-9f54-8050a1dbc001,Development

The FarmId must be listed as the Id in the SPFarm.csv lookup and the
FarmName can be anything you want.  Use standard CSV formatting (i.e.
quote if necessary).

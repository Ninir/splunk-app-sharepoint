## Introduction
The Splunk App for SharePoint provides dashboards and saved searches for use in a Splunk 6 environment when monitoring SharePoint
2010 or SharePoint 2013 with the appropriate Technology Add-on (available from http://apps.splunk.com/app/1908/)

This release does not provide the data inputs - just the required app.

To build the Splunk App for SharePoint, you will need a recent version of Java and Apache Ant 1.9.2.

To build a full distribution:
